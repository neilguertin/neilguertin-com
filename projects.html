<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Footsteps</h3>
As a competitive runner, I often want to look back at and analyze my running data. Unfortunately existing platforms make this nearly impossible to do. I want to be able to answer questions like,
<ul>
    <li>When was the last time I ran to that neighborhood?</li>
    <li>What was that workout I did? I know it was at that track across town.</li>
    <li>Show me all of my 5K races so I can quickly compare them.</li>
    <li>What pace do I usually run my easy runs at?</li>
    <li>How much am I training for this marathon compared to my last one?</li>
</ul>

Frustrated by existing platforms, I set out to build my own. It is entirely focused on look back and what you've done and where you've been (hence the name, Footsteps). It allows you to search and filter all your runs by any field: Description, Distance, Day of the week, GPS, just to name a few. It also includes some basic running analytics, calculating stress per run and also fatigue and training volume over time.

<h3>My Timeline</h3>
<p>For several years now I have been tracking my location, processing it, and then mapping and analyzing it. I even built a website for viewing it by date and by travel mode. I can't share the website for obvious reasons but here's an example, everywhere I went in 2024.</p>

<h3>Websites</h3>
<h4>neilguertin.com</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.neilguertin.com">https://www.neilguertin.com</a></p>
<p>This one! First hand coded HTML and CSS, then PHP, and now built with Jekyll. This is a safe place for me to experiment.</p>
<h4>contramontreal.org</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.contramontreal.org">https://www.contramontreal.org</a></p>
<p>Also built with Jekyll. A real website with hundreds of visitors every month. And useful features like easy language switching and automatically displaying the info for the next dance.</p>
